# Machine_learning_HW
* This assignment introduced us to machine learning and specifically covered the following topics.
    * Preprocessing the data in preparation for analysis. Which included 
        * Separating the data into sets, a training set and a testing set. Allowing us to training the model with one set of data and then test the model's predictive abilities with an out of sample data set.
        * The data we worked with was unbalanced. As such, we had to utilize some of Python's oversampling methods like Random Oversampling and SMOTE. We also, used an undersampling technique, Cluster Centroids and combination technique, SMOTEENN.
    * Logistic Regression model
    * Classification models 
        * Balanced Random Forest Classifier
        * Random Foresst (Easy Ensemble) Classifier
* We analyzed loan data and tried to determine how effective our models were at predicting high risk loans.
    * For the logistic regression the SMOTE and SMOTEENN models tended to perform better.
    * The Balanced Random Forest was the better performing classification model.
